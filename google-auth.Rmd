# Google Authorization and R

EcoHealth Alliance regularly uses Google drive, and Google sheets in particular, to
store and collaborate on files. Working with Google drive based files in R is 
relatively painless thanks to the [`googledrive`](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/), [`googlesheets4`](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/index.html), and 
[`gargle`](https://gargle.r-lib.org/index.html) packages. 

What is less straight forward is working with drive
based files without having to manually authenticate
your identity. In this chapter, we will walk through the process 
creating credentials with API access that can be used in your R project or package. Ultimately, this could allow you to fully automate your google centric data pipelines.

**The basic overview:**

0) Create or store something (sheet, csv, doc, etc.) in google drive 
1) Create a google cloud project to manage google services  
2) Enable the appropriate API's for the project so it can access things like drive and sheets.
3) Create a service account so that you can access the APIs via credentials from R
4) Encrypt credentials then add them to your R project so that you can still use git based work flows without leaking access to your service account 
5) Share google based resources with the service account and check that credentials work as expected from R
6) Add encryption key to RStudio Connect or Github as an environmental variable

**Key Terms**

- Authentication - Confirms the identity of an entity
- Authorization - Permits an entity to do something
  - Auth - short hand for authentication or authorization
- Key - computer generated credentials that allow for authorization and authentication. In the R-google universe key and token are synonyms. You will see them used interchangeably in tutorials 
- Token - Computer generated credentials that allow for authentication and authorization. Tokens and keys are communicated over the web using different methods. Google service accounts do not have tokens, they have keys
- Symmetric encryption - A type of encryption that uses a single  key to encrypt and decrypt an object
- Environment variable - A value stored in `.Renviron`. These values can be brought into your project using `Sys.getenv("Variable_Name")` and are very useful for storing sensitive information like tokens and keys.
- Service - Functionality provided by another system i.e. serving data via an API. 
- GCP - Google cloud platform. Web services from google.


*Disclaimer* This is one workflow for encryption. It is used to avoid setting up more complicated but more secure `git-crypt`. For projects that require 
encrypted workflows, see chapter \@ref(encryption).  

*Credit* This chapter largely follows the  [non-interactive auth vignette](https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/non-interactive-auth.html), but diverges for package and non-package focused projects. 

**What about Billing?** Good question. This is not an issue for sheets or drive APIs but you do need a linked billing account for BigQuery and Maps APIs. If you're new to GCP as of 29 Sept 2021 you get $300 of credits in the Free Tier. If you use the $300 in credits GCP will ask for consent before billing.

## Setting up non-interactive authentication for Google sheets

In this chapter, we will walk through setting up credentials that can be used in R to access Google sheets without manual authentication. To achieve non-interactive authorization, we want to either provide a _token_ directly to a service or make a token discoverable for a service.  A token is essentially a long password, designed to be exchanged by machines but too long and complexly formatted to be used by people, and often time-limited. Remember that tokens, secrets, and API keys should be stored in a secure fashion (NOT stored in the text of your code or in unencrypted files). 

We are going to follow the recommended (as of 29 September 2021) strategy of 
providing a service account _key_ directly to handle authorization. A newer approach called
workload identity federation exists as of writing but is not fully implemented 
in the `gargle` package.

###  Create a google cloud platform project

"Google Cloud projects form the basis for creating, enabling, and using all Google Cloud services including managing APIs, enabling billing, adding and removing collaborators, and managing permissions for Google Cloud resources."

In this instance we are using a GCP project to access the google sheets API via a service account. You do not need a profound understanding of GCP projects to setup a 
service account. 

[GCP Docs](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)


- Setup/View your [Google cloud account](https://console.cloud.Google.com/)
- Create a project on Google cloud to hold your credentials 
![gcp console](./assets/gcp_console.png)
![gcp project init](./assets/gcp_create_proj.png)
- The GCP console is your destination for monitoring and modifying your projects


### Enable APIs

GCP Projects are centered on the idea that a single project will contain a single application.
In our case, the application we are creating relies on the google sheets API. You can enable API's for our application to access via the APIs & Services menu item. 

- In the left side menu, navigate to APIs & Services > Library 
![naviate to Library](./assets/gcp_nav_lib.png)
- Choose your api of interest. For this example it is Google sheets.
![find sheets](./assets/gcp_find_sheets.png)
- Enable the api of interest. *If you need to enable more API's later you can
always come back*
![enable sheets](./assets/gcp_enable_sheets.png)

### Create a Service Account

Service accounts allow applications, like the GCP project we make, to access certain resources they need via authorized API calls. The service account's access can be limited such that
it can only access specific resources in a certain way. 

Importantly, service accounts are not part of the EHA workspace domain. You have to manually share resources like google sheets with a service account even if you have provided domain level access. 

[GCP Service Account Docs](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)

- Navigate back to your project homepage
- In the left sidebar go to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts
![gcp_nav_service](assets/gcp_nav_service.png)
- Click create service account
- Give it a good name and description
![gcp_create_service_acnt](./assets/gcp_create_service_acnt.png)
- For Google sheets, we do not need to assign our account service a role
  - Roles can be established to perform tests and otherwise manage the service
  but are not necessary
- Also not necessary to grant user access for this example
  - You may have a need for this with more complicated services
  - It may also be a good idea to get some redundancy in your workflow
![gcp_service_setup](./assets/gcp_service_setup.png)

### Create a Key for your service account

This is what we have been waiting for. Remember that this key will hold very
sensitive information and we should treat it like a username and password combo.

- Click on the appropriate item in the service accounts table. *Notice that it says no key*
![gcp_nav_key](./assets/gcp_nav_key.png)
- Click on the keys tab, then click on **ADD KEY**
![gcp_add_key](./assets/gcp_add_key.png)
- Select Create new key and download the JSON file. This file can be stored in Keybase, Bitwarden or another encrypted file storage system. 
![gcp_get_key](./assets/gcp_get_key.png)

- You should now see that there is an active key associated with your service account
in the GCP project. 

### Share the Google drive resources of interest with the service account

- **Make sure your sheet is shared with the service account**
- Remember that service accounts do not belong the EHA domain so there will be extra 
prompts when sharing resources. 



### General approach to securely managing keys

This workflow uses the relatively simple approach of symmetric encryption to securely store files on shared resources like a github repository.

1) Unencrypted keys should NOT be stored in shared or public locations
    - If possible store in an encrypted volume. Keybase, bitwarden, and other credential management storage systems generally allow you to store files in an encrypted manner. 
2) 

Skip ahead to [Provide a service account key for Projects] if you are using the key in a project that does not produce a package. 

### Securely managing your keys for Packages

So now you have this super secret key but need to make it accessible to your
R package. We can use the `sodium` package as well as functions in `gargle` to
password protect the JSON file that stores our key. We can then store the
password as an environmental variable in the project. Notice that we are using
the `:::` in function calls. See [this article](https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/articles/managing-tokens-securely.html) for more details.

#### Generate a password name

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(sodium)
library(gargle)
library(usethis)

pw_name <- gargle:::secret_pw_name("gargle")

```

#### Generate a random password

***KEEP THIS PASSWORD A SECRET*** 

- See the [Encryption](#encryption) chapter for more information about setting up encryption. You can use Keybase to setup encrypted storage on your machine. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
pw <- gargle:::secret_pw_gen()

#> someSecretComplicatedPassword
```

#### Add PW and PW_NAME to your Environmental variables

- It is strongly recommended that this live in the user level environment to avoid
accidentally passing the variable to a git repo. 
```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::edit_r_environ(scope = "user")
```

#### Give the env variable to services (Optional)

If you're running this process on a service like [RSConnect](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/03/02/rstudio-connect-v1-5-14/#:~:text=Environment%20variables%20for%20executable%20content,and%20are%20encrypted%20at%20rest.) or [Github Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets),
you must provide it to the service. 

#### Encrypt the Secret File

```{r eval=FALSE}
gargle:::secret_write(
  package = "myCoolPackage",
  name = "sheets-demo-key.json",
  input = "keybase://private/myname/longComplicatedFile.json"
)

```

#### Test that you can decrypt

```{r eval=FALSE}
if(gargle:::secret_can_decrypt("myCoolPackage")){
  json<- gargle:::secret_read("sheets-demo-key.json")
  googlesheets4::gs4_auth(path = rawToChar(json))
}
```

### Provide a service account key for Projects

Inspired by the workflow described in [ROpenSci:Security](https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing/security-chapter.html) with additional information from [sodium vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sodium/vignettes/intro.html) and [gargle vignette](https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/articles/managing-tokens-securely.html).

#### Symetrically encrypt your file

We are creating a secret passphrase to encrypt our very secret key file.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(cyphr)
library(sodium)
library(usethis)

## Generate a secret password and store it in you local environment

usethis::edit_r_environ(scope = "user")

## in the .Renviron file
# GOOGLE_AUTH_JSON_PW=Your-Generated-Secret-Passphrase7

get_sodium_key <- function(env_var_name = "GOOGLE_AUTH_JSON_PW"){

  pw <- Sys.getenv(env_name)

  k <- sodium::hash(charToRaw(pw))

  key <- cyphr::key_sodium(k)

  return(key)

}

key <- get_sodium_key()

dir.create("./inst/tokens",recursive = T)

cyphr::encrypt_file(path = "keybase://private/myname/longComplicatedFile.json",dest = "./inst/tokens/longComplicatedFile.json", key = key)

# to get a string version of the key which can be copied, pasted, and stored as an environment variable.
sodium::bin2hex(key$key())



```

#### Provide key to auth function

Point the `gs4_auth` function to the de-encrypted json string

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(googlesheets4)

key <- get_sodium_key()

jsonRaw <- cyphr:::decrypt_file("../inst/tokens/longComplicatedFile.json",key = key)

jsonChar <- rawToChar(jsonRaw)

googlesheets4::gs4_auth(path = jsonChar)

```

### Read in your sheet

**Make sure your sheet is shared with the service account...**

```{r eval=FALSE}

googlesheets4::read_sheet("https://docs.Google.com/spreadsheets/that/i/definitely/shared/with/the/service-account")


```
